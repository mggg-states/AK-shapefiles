# Alaska Election Shapefile
This shapefile was obtained from the Alaska Division of Elections and processed by members of the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG). 

## Sources
The precinct shapefile and election results were downloaded from the [Alaska Division of Elections website](http://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/electionresources.php). Demographic data was downloaded from the 2010 Decennial Census at the census block level from [IPUMS NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org).

## Processing
Election data from the Alaska Division of Elections was cleaned and converted to a CSV by MGGG staff so it could be joined to the precinct shapefile. Demographic data was aggregated from the block level to the precinct level using [MGGGâ€™s proration and roundoff tools](https://github.com/gerrymandr/Preprocessing). Roundoff was used to assign Alaska house districts to precincts.
